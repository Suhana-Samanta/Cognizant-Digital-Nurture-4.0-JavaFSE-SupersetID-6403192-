# 📘 BloggerApp

A structured and visually clean ReactJS application developed as part of a hands-on lab exercise.
This project demonstrates the use of **conditional rendering**, **component composition**, and **list rendering** using the `map()` function with keys, enhanced by custom CSS for a professional "blogger-style" layout.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This application satisfies the following learning goals:

* ✅ Demonstrate conditional rendering in React
* ✅ Render multiple independent components together
* ✅ Use of `.map()` and keys to dynamically render data lists
* ✅ Apply clean and readable CSS styling

## 🛠 Features Overview

The UI consists of **three parallel sections** displayed side by side:

| Section               | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 📚 **Course Details** | Lists course name and date                      |
| 📘 **Book Details**   | Lists book title and price                      |
| ✍️ **Blog Details**   | Lists blog title, author, and short description |

Each card is styled with a **clean white background** and a **green left border**, using a consistent typography hierarchy to distinguish content types.

## 🧩 Components Breakdown

| Component          | Role                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CourseDetails.js` | Renders a list of course names with associated dates     |
| `BookDetails.js`   | Renders a list of book titles with pricing information   |

## 🎨 Styling Principles

This application follows a modern and clean blogger-style layout with:

* **Section Titles**: Large, green-colored
* **Item Titles**: Bold and larger than content text
* **Author Names**: Bold but smaller than titles
* **Dates, Prices, Descriptions**: Smallest font size in subtle grey
