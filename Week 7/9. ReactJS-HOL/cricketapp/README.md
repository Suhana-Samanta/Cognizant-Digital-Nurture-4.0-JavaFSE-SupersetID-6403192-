# 🏏 Cricket App – 9. ReactJS Hands-On

This project is a **ReactJS application** built as part of the **ES6 + ReactJS Hands-On Lab**. The goal is to demonstrate usage of **ES6 features** like `map()`, arrow functions, destructuring, conditional rendering, and reusable components.

---

## 📌 Features Implemented

### ✅ ListofPlayers Component
- Displays 11 players with their names and scores.
- Uses `map()` to display all players.
- Uses `filter()` and **arrow functions** to show players with score < 70.


### ✅ IndianPlayers Component
- Two separate arrays: `T20Players` and `RanjiPlayers`
- Uses **ES6 Spread Operator** to merge both arrays.
- Uses **destructuring** to extract odd and even team players.
- Merged list displayed with names prefixed by `Mr.`
