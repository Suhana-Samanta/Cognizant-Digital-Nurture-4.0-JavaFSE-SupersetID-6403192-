# Create a Spring Web Project using Maven

This exercise involved creating a basic Spring Boot web application using **Spring Initializr** and running it in **Visual Studio Code**.

## 📌 Objective  
To generate a Spring Boot project with essential dependencies, customize its main class with startup logs, and verify execution via console output.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Java 21  
- Spring Boot 3.5.3  
- Spring Initializr  
- Maven  
- Visual Studio Code

## 🧪 Steps Followed

### 1. Project Generation  
A Spring Boot project was generated from [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) with the following configuration:
- Group ID: `com.cognizant`
- Artifact ID: `spring-learn`
- Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools

### 2. Project Setup in VS Code  
The generated project was opened in **VS Code** and managed using **Maven**.

### 3. Main Class with Custom Logging  
The `main()` method was updated with console-based logging to track application start and status:

```java
package com.cognizant.spring_learn;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringLearnApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("\n==================================================");
		System.out.println("INFO: Initializing SpringLearn Application...");
		System.out.println("INFO: Launching the application context...");
		System.out.println("==================================================\n");

		SpringApplication.run(SpringLearnApplication.class, args);

		System.out.println("\n==================================================");
		System.out.println("INFO: SpringLearn Application started successfully.");
		System.out.println("==================================================\n");
	}
}
````

### 4. Output Verification

The application was run using the integrated terminal in VS Code, and the custom log messages were displayed as expected.

## ✅ Output

The Spring Boot application initialized and started successfully with clearly formatted log messages in the console.
