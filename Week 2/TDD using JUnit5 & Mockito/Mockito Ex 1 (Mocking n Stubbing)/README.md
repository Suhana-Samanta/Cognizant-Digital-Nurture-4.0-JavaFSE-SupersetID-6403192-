# Exercise 1: Mocking a Service Dependency in a Controller Test

In this exercise, a service dependency in a Spring controller was mocked using **Mockito**, and a unit test was written to verify the controller's behavior.

## 📌 Task  
The objective was to test a Spring REST controller by mocking its dependent service class to isolate functionality.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- JUnit  
- Mockito  
- Maven  
- Visual Studio Code

### 4. UserController Test

A test class was written using **Mockito** to mock the `UserService` and verify controller behavior. The test ensured that the controller could return mocked user data without accessing the actual database.

## ✅ Output

The test was executed successfully, and the mock service provided the expected response, verifying the controller's correctness.
