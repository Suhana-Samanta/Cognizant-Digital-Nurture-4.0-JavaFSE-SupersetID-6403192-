# Exercise 4: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern, Test Fixtures, Setup and Teardown Methods in JUnit

In this exercise, the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern was followed to structure test cases, and setup/teardown methods were used to manage test fixtures.

## 📌 Scenario  
The objective was to organize unit tests using the AAA pattern and implement setup and teardown logic using JUnit annotations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Java  
- JUnit 4 (v4.13.2)  
- Maven  
- Visual Studio Code

## 🧪 Steps Followed

### 1. AAA Pattern Implementation  
Test methods were written following the three-phase structure:
- **Arrange**: Prepare test data and environment  
- **Act**: Perform the action or call the method  
- **Assert**: Verify the result

### 2. Setup and Teardown  
- The `@Before` annotation was used to execute setup logic before each test.
- The `@After` annotation was used to handle cleanup after each test.

## ✅ Output  
Tests were executed successfully, with setup and teardown methods called appropriately for each test case.
