# Exercise 3: Assertions in JUnit

In this exercise, various JUnit assertions were used to validate different test conditions in a Java application.

## 📌 Scenario  
The objective was to demonstrate the use of multiple assertion methods available in **JUnit 4** to verify expected outcomes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Java  
- JUnit 4 (v4.13.2)  
- Maven  
- Visual Studio Code

## 🧪 Steps Followed

### 1. Test Class Creation  
A test class was created, and different types of assertions were implemented to validate logic conditions.

### 2. Assertions Used  
The following assertion methods were demonstrated:
- `assertEquals()`
- `assertTrue()`
- `assertFalse()`
- `assertNull()`
- `assertNotNull()`

````

## ✅ Output
All assertions were executed successfully, confirming the correctness of each test condition.
