# Singleton Pattern Example

This project demonstrates how to implement the **Singleton design pattern** for a logging utility class.  
The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the logger exists throughout the application lifecycle to provide consistent logging.

I ensured that a logging utility class in my application has only one instance across the entire application.
